# 0x04 Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

This project is part of the ALx Software Engineering programme.

The aim of this project is to learn the following:
- What are sets and how to use them
- What are the most common methods of set and how to use them
- How to iterate into a set
- What are dictionaries and how to use them
- When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
- What is a key in a dictionary
- How to iterate over a dictionary
- What is a lambda function
- What are the map, reduce and filter functions
